# Exploration of New York Police Salary Data 2014 - 2019
This notebook is intended as a exploration of various statistics and comparisons surrounding NY Police Officer & Police Department salaries from the years 2014 - 2019. Given recent events and discourse on social media platforms like Twitter, I found it pertinent to explore these statistics with the aim of answering various questions, including:

How are Police Officers paid differently from other city employees?
What departments of the city are paid the most?
Do Police Officers receive Overtime Pay at higher rates, or as a percentage of their salary?

Additional questions may include salaries for Police Department Employees, rather than just Police officers.
